All those things to remember, all those questions to ask.

## Some Preliminary Questions

### Administrative
- When is the deadline for completion?
- What is the budget?
- How will development be managed?

### Marketing
- Why is the site needed?
- Who is the audience of the site?
- How will the audience use the site?
- What should the audience come away with after visiting the site?
- What are the short term goals of the site?
- What are the long term goals of the site?

### Technical
- What kind of server will the site run on?
- What kind of technology will power the site?
- Which browsers will need to experience the site?
- How will the site be updated? How often?

#### Regarding Browser Compatibility

Different operating systems and web browsers render sites in different ways. In many cases, developing a site that is compatible between the major browsers can present a minefield of conflicts. Also, as these browsers are updated, new technologies become available that greatly improve site development. However, when these new technologies are viewed in older browsers without these features, the results vary from graceful degradations to flatout missing functionality.

## Pages

When potential visitors search Google, Bing, or whatever else, they scan over the page titles and descriptions. Therefore, it is extremely important that page titles clearly indicate what they can expect from a page. Consider including a promise in a page description which describes something useful that the page will deliver, and include a few words about how the reader will benefit.

### Titles

The title is one of the most important factors for a successful search engine optimization of a site. The title provides a summarized explanation of the page, and it is what will appear on search result pages. Yahoo will display up to 120 characters of a title, cropping to complete words. Google will display up to 66 characters of a title, cropping to complete words. The iPhone will display up to 12 characters of the title, cropping to complete words. In one study, 55% of the high traffic sites had a title length between 40 to 100 characters. All together, the page title length should be limited to 66 characters, including spaces and punctuation. It is highly recommended that every page have a unique title.

### Description

The description should detail what information the page contains or what the page is about. It is very important to write short and clear sentences that will not confuse potential visitors, as it is often displayed in a search engine result page. It should include as much information as possible, as it will improve search engine optimization. However, the description must be less than 200 characters, and preferably less than 150, as the description greatly effects the SEO optimization of a page. In one study, 70% of high traffic sites had a description of 80 to 220 characters.

## Pages Questionnaire

#### Regarding Facebook Pages

Be clear and concise when naming a Facebook page. Do not include high value generic keywords. If the Facebook page appears too spam-like, potential followers will be less likely to share it with others and more likely to hide that page's updates from their feed. Furthermore, do not create pages with generic titles, like "Travel" or "Hawaii". Facebook pages are designed to represent businesses, brands, and celebrities. Understandably, Facebook has been known to disable updates from generically named pages.
